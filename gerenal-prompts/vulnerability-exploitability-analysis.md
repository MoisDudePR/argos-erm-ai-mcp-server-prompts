# Vulnerability Exploitability Analysis

## Use Case
Determine which vulnerabilities represent real-world risk.

## MCP Context
- CVEs
- Exploit intelligence
- Asset exposure
- Technology stack

## Prompt
You are analyzing externally exposed vulnerabilities using ERM MCP data.

For identified CVEs:
- Assess exploit availability and active exploitation
- Map vulnerabilities to exposed assets
- Determine which vulnerabilities pose immediate risk

Provide:
1. A list of exploitable vulnerabilities
2. Assets affected
3. Risk justification
4. Recommended remediation actions

## Expected Output
- Analyst-level depth
- Threat-informed prioritization
- Clear remediation guidance
