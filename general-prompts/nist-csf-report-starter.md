# NIST CSF–Aligned External Risk Report Starter

## Use Case
Initiate a structured external cyber risk report aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) using ERM data.

## MCP Context
- Asset inventory
- Exposure findings
- Risk trends
- Threat intelligence
- Remediation status

## Prompt
You are preparing an external cyber risk assessment aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

Using Check Point Infinity ERM data via the MCP server:
- Assess the organization’s external risk posture
- Map relevant findings to the five NIST CSF functions:
  - Identify
  - Protect
  - Detect
  - Respond
  - Recover

For each NIST function:
- Summarize current maturity from an external risk perspective
- Highlight key strengths and gaps
- Reference relevant ERM findings that support the assessment

Begin the report with:
1. An executive summary describing overall external cyber risk
2. A brief explanation of how ERM data informs NIST CSF alignment
3. A high-level maturity overview across all five NIST functions

Do not include deep technical detail at this stage. Focus on structure, clarity, and executive-ready language.

## Expected Output
- Clear NIST CSF–aligned structure
- Business-oriented language
- A strong foundation for deeper analysis in subsequent sections
